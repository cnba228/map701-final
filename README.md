## Power and Authority Behind Cholera Mapping

I've focused on a comparing Amariah Brigham and David Merediths perspective on the cholera outbreak. Brigham, an American psychiatrist, illustrated the spread of cholera from India to China, Europe, and North America through a trade-route style map. Meredith had a conflicting perspective on the spread of cholera, and instead created a map that reflected his belief that the disease was spread through consumption of noxious air via rotting matter.
