# Map 701-201 Final Project
## Power and Authority Behind Cholera Mapping

I plan to focus on Amariahs Brigham’s 1832 map of the cholera outbreak. Brigham, an American psychiatrist, illustrated the spread of cholera from India to China, Europe, and North America through a trade-route style map. I plan to pull from several of our readings, specifically Susan Schulten’s “The Cartographic Consolidation of America” and Judith Tyner’s “Persuasive Cartography.”

Disease maps have become a staple figure in the visual rhetoric of a disease outbreak. I found some interesting information on scholars, like Schulten, having examined cholera maps as examples of nineteenth-century disease history maps and the fear associated with text becoming this visual. I’m hoping to dive into this a little more as I examine this piece in my final project.
